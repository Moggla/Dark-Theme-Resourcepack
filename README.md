This Resourcepack changes only the HUD and some text colors of your game. This means you can still use it together with other Resourcepacks. There are quite a lot of Resourcepacks like this out there, but this one has no accent colors. I tried to get the same dark shades as the Windows dark theme. In addition to this I've added highlights to some texts (for Example colored difficult levels).
I have colored all language files with [this generator](https://github.com/Moggla/MC_Language_Formatter).
